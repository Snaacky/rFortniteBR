# /r/FortniteBR
Tools that keep /r/FortniteBR afloat, AutoModerator, bots, and CSS.

## Contents:
`fortnitebr.css` - The CSS for /r/FortniteBR. All other subreddits (/r/Fortnite, /r/FortniteCreative, /r/FortniteMobile, etc.) are recolored derivatives of this file with slight differences on a subreddit-to-subreddit basis. You can find the latest revision of the CSS [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fortnitebr/about/stylesheet/).

`fortnitebr.yaml` - The YAML that makes up the AutoModerator config for /r/FortniteBR. This is heavily modified on /r/Fortnite, mostly the same on /r/FortniteMobile, and slightly modified on /r/FortniteCreative.

`metabot.py` - The Discord bot we used to monitor /r/FortniteBRMeta to get near real-time notifications when a user created a new thread in the meta subreddit.

[TiltedTowersBot](https://github.com/Snaacky/TiltedTowersBot) - The bot used on /r/FortniteBR to automatically take down posts that haven't been flaired within 30 minutes of being posted. Written in Python 3.x, co-authored by [SirPacker](https://github.com/SirPacker). This is the code that now runs /u/NoSkinBot.
