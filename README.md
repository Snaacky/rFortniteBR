# /r/FortniteBR
A repository containing some of the items that I worked on during my tenure as a head mod for /r/FortniteBR and the collective family of developer supported subreddits.

---

## Contents:
`fortnitebr.css` - Contains the CSS for /r/FortniteBR. All other subreddits (/r/Fortnite, /r/FortniteCreative, /r/FortniteMobile, etc.) are recolored derivatives of this file with slight differences on a subreddit-to-subreddit basis. You can find the latest revision of the CSS [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fortnitebr/about/stylesheet/).


`fortnitebr.yaml` - Contains the YAML that makes up the AutoModerator config for /r/FortniteBR. This is heavily modified on /r/Fortnite, mostly the same on /r/FortniteMobile, and slightly modified on /r/FortniteCreative.

`metabot.py` - Contains the Discord bot we used to monitor /r/FortniteBRMeta so that we would get near real-time notifications when a user created a new thread in the meta subreddit.

[TiltedTowersBot](https://github.com/Snaacky/TiltedTowersBot) - A repository containing the bot used on /r/FortniteBR to automatically take down posts that haven't been flaired within 30 minutes of being posted. Written in Python 3.x, co-authored by [SirPacker](https://github.com/SirPacker). This is the code that now runs /u/NoSkinBot although there is no relation other than them using our codebase and renaming it.

[fortnite-subreddit](https://github.com/fortnite-subreddit) - A organization with all the legacy tools used on /r/FortniteBR before the removal of [MasterGoat](https://github.com/MasterGoat) and [DoctorJew](https://github.com/doctorjew).
