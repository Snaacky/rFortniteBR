        - You can flair when posting on mobile BEFORE you post or by using the "..." button
        
        - You can flair on PC AFTER you post, directly under the last sentence or image are options to flair the post
        
        - Failure to flair you post will result in its removal.  We will NOT manually update the flair, do not send ModMail
        
        - If you failed to flair your video, you will have to wait again to repost it, our bot will not allow this until the cooldown is over.  Text posts or images can be reposted right away.


    For more information as to why you have to flair, please read [our flair update](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8bznpy/state_of_the_subreddit_new_moderators_survey/).

    Thanks!
